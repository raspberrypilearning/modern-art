## Challenge: Turtle art

Can you define a `randomheading()` function that will make the turtle point in a random direction and make the following code work?

Hints:

- `setheading(<number>)` will change the direction the turtle is facing in.

- `<number>` should be between 1 and 360 (the number of degrees in a circle)

- You can use `randint(1, 360)` to choose a number between 1 and 360.
