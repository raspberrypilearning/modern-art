## Challenge: More modern art

Can you create a function that draws a shape and calls your `randomcolour()` and / or `randomplace()` functions?

You can call your function from inside a `for` loop as you did in the rectangle art to generate modern art.

Ideas:

- Turtles have a function called dot that takes a radius (distance from the centre to the edge of the circle) as input. E.g. turtle.dot(10) You could create a `drawcircle()` function that draws a circle with a random radius.

- Look in `snippets.py` for example code to draw stars with the turtle.
